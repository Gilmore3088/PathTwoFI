Before making updates to fix the about.tsx file, here are the key things to consider:
Things to Consider Before Updates:
1. Variable Duplication vs. Shared Constants
Instead of duplicating these calculations in multiple files, consider creating a shared constants/calculations file:
tsx// client/src/lib/fire-calculations.ts
export const FIRE_GOALS = {
  currentNetWorth: 679000,
  fireGoalToday: 3500000,
  stretchGoalToday: 4000000,
  yearsToFire: 14,
  inflationRate: 0.03,
};

export const calculateFireMetrics = () => {
  const inflationMultiplier = Math.pow(1 + FIRE_GOALS.inflationRate, FIRE_GOALS.yearsToFire);
  return {
    fireGoalFuture: FIRE_GOALS.fireGoalToday * inflationMultiplier,
    stretchGoalFuture: FIRE_GOALS.stretchGoalToday * inflationMultiplier,
    progressToFire: (FIRE_GOALS.currentNetWorth / (FIRE_GOALS.fireGoalToday * inflationMultiplier)) * 100,
    progressToStretch: (FIRE_GOALS.currentNetWorth / (FIRE_GOALS.stretchGoalToday * inflationMultiplier)) * 100,
  };
};
2. Data Source of Truth
Your about.tsx has hardcoded currentNetWorthExclHome = 679 on line 117, but this should ideally come from your actual wealth data API to stay current. Consider whether to:

Keep it hardcoded for now
Fetch from API like the dashboard does
Update manually as needed

3. Inconsistent Naming
Line 117 uses currentNetWorthExclHome but the progress bar references just currentNetWorth. Make sure variable names are consistent.
4. Milestone Updates
Your milestones still show "$631K Combined" for July 2025, but you're now at $679K. Update this and any other outdated milestones.
5. Remove Unused Code
Lines 117-127 define calculations but they're never used because the variables referenced in the JSX don't exist. Either remove these or properly connect them.
6. Test Other Pages
After fixing about.tsx, check that:

Dashboard still works
Home page renders
Blog pages load

7. Error Boundaries
Consider adding error boundaries to prevent one component's crash from taking down the whole app.
Immediate Fix Needed:
Add these lines right after line 18 in about.tsx:
tsx// FIRE calculations
const fireGoalToday = 3500000;
const stretchGoalToday = 4000000;
const yearsToFire = 14;
const inflationRate = 0.03;
const inflationMultiplier = Math.pow(1 + inflationRate, yearsToFire);
const fireGoalFuture = fireGoalToday * inflationMultiplier;
const stretchGoalFuture = stretchGoalToday * inflationMultiplier;
const currentNetWorth = 679000; // Your current net worth excluding home
const progressToFire = (currentNetWorth / fireGoalFuture) * 100;
const progressToStretch = (currentNetWorth / stretchGoalFuture) * 100;
And remove the duplicate calculations on lines 117-127 since they define different variable names.
