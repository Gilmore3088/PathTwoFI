# Admin Metrics & Insights Page ("My Insights")

## Purpose
Create a private admin dashboard that gives James Gilmore a comprehensive view of blog performance and audience behavior, including traffic trends, top posts, SEO health, subscriber growth, and how Wealth Update posts correlate with traffic spikes. The dashboard should feel like a personal command center that combines storytelling metrics with financial tracker context to highlight when major milestones drove interest.

## Access & Structure
- **Single user**: only the admin (James Gilmore) can view the dashboard.
- **Private access**: served at the `/admin` route and secured through Supabase authentication or a static access key.
- **No shared analytics**: no additional roles or user management.
- **Data freshness**: dashboard refreshes automatically on a daily cadence.

## Layout Overview
### A. Global Controls
- **Date range picker** with presets for Today, 7D, 30D, 90D, and a Custom range.
- **Comparison toggle** to compare selected dates against the previous period.
